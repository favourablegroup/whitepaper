        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mt-10">Smart Contracts</h2>
        <p>
          TritCoin includes a Turing-complete smart contract platform that leverages balanced ternary for more efficient
          computation and storage. The TritScript language allows developers to write contracts that execute with
          predictable gas costs and enhanced security guarantees.
        </p>

        <p>Key features of TritCoin smart contracts include:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Native support for balanced ternary operations</li>
          <li>Formal verification tools to prove contract correctness</li>
          <li>Deterministic execution with bounded computational resources</li>
          <li>Interoperability with existing blockchain ecosystems</li>
        </ul>
