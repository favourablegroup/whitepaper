        <p>
          The TritCoin project is committed to ongoing research and development to further enhance the capabilities and
          applications of balanced ternary computing in blockchain systems. Our research roadmap includes:

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mt-10">Scaling Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          While TritCoin's balanced ternary architecture already provides significant efficiency improvements over
          binary-based systems, we are actively developing additional scaling solutions:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Ternary Sharding:</strong> A novel sharding approach that leverages the mathematical properties of
            balanced ternary to create more efficient cross-shard communication protocols.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trit-State Channels:</strong> Off-chain scaling solution optimized for balanced ternary computation,
            enabling high-throughput applications with minimal on-chain footprint.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Recursive Zero-Knowledge Proofs:</strong> Implementing zkSNARKs adapted for ternary computation to
            enable efficient verification of complex computations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adaptive Block Sizing:</strong> Dynamic adjustment of block parameters based on network conditions
            to optimize throughput while maintaining security guarantees.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mt-10">Interoperability</h2>
        <p>
          TritCoin is designed to operate within the broader blockchain ecosystem. We are developing bridges and
          protocols to enable seamless interoperability:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Cross-Chain Communication Protocol:</strong> A standardized protocol for secure communication
            between TritCoin and binary-based blockchains.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Asset Wrapping:</strong> Mechanisms to represent external assets on the TritCoin blockchain with
            cryptographic proofs of backing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Atomic Swaps:</strong> Trustless exchange of assets between TritCoin and other blockchain networks
            without intermediaries.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Oracle Integration:</strong> Secure bridges to bring real-world data onto the TritCoin blockchain
            for use in smart contracts and applications.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mt-10">Hardware Development</h2>
        <p>
          While TritCoin is designed to run efficiently on existing binary hardware, we are exploring the development of
          specialized hardware to fully realize the potential of balanced ternary computing:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Ternary ASICs:</strong> Application-specific integrated circuits optimized for balanced ternary
            operations, providing orders of magnitude improvements in efficiency for mining and transaction validation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quantum-Resistant Hardware Wallets:</strong> Specialized hardware security modules that implement
            TritCoin's post-quantum cryptographic primitives for secure key storage and transaction signing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Low-Power IoT Modules:</strong> Energy-efficient hardware modules that enable resource-constrained
            IoT devices to participate in the TritCoin network.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mt-10">Governance Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          The TritCoin protocol will transition to a fully decentralized governance model through a phased approach:
        </p>

        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Foundation Governance (Current):</strong> Protocol decisions made by the TritCoin Foundation with
            community input.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hybrid Governance (2024-2025):</strong> Introduction of on-chain proposal and voting mechanisms
            alongside foundation oversight.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>DAO Governance (2026+):</strong> Full transition to a decentralized autonomous organization where
            protocol changes are determined entirely through on-chain voting.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p className="mt-6">
          This governance evolution will ensure that TritCoin remains adaptable to emerging challenges and opportunities
          while maintaining its commitment to decentralization and community ownership.
