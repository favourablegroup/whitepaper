        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight">Consensus Mechanism</h2>
        <p>
          TritCoin employs a novel consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Balance (PoB), which leverages the mathematical
          properties of balanced ternary to achieve consensus with significantly reduced computational requirements
          compared to traditional Proof-of-Work systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          In PoB, validators must find a balanced ternary value that, when hashed with the block data, produces a hash
          with specific properties. Unlike binary-based systems that require brute force to find a hash with a certain
          number of leading zeros, PoB looks for hashes with balanced distribution of trits, making the process more
          energy-efficient.
        </p>

        <CodeBlock
          language="typescript"
          code={`
function validateBlock(block, difficulty) {
  const blockData = serializeBlock(block);
  const nonce = block.nonce; // Balanced ternary value
  
  const hash = tritHash(blockData + nonce);
  
  // Check if hash meets difficulty requirements
  return isBalanced(hash, difficulty);
}

function isBalanced(hash, difficulty) {
  // Count the number of -1, 0, and 1 in the first 'difficulty' trits
  const counts = countTrits(hash.slice(0, difficulty));
  
  // Check if the distribution is balanced within tolerance
  const tolerance = Math.floor(difficulty * 0.1);
  const target = difficulty / 3;
  
  return Math.abs(counts[-1] - target) <= tolerance &&
         Math.abs(counts[0] - target) <= tolerance &&
         Math.abs(counts[1] - target) <= tolerance;
}`}
        />

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mt-10">Transaction Structure</h2>
        <p>
          TritCoin transactions are encoded in balanced ternary, providing a compact and efficient representation. Each
          transaction contains the following components:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Sender Address:</strong> A balanced ternary public key derived from the sender's private key
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Recipient Address:</strong> The balanced ternary public key of the recipient
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Amount:</strong> The transaction amount encoded in balanced ternary
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Timestamp:</strong> Transaction creation time
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Signature:</strong> A cryptographic signature proving ownership of the sender address
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Transaction Fee:</strong> Optional fee to prioritize transaction processing
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mt-10">Balanced Ternary Converter</h2>
        <p>
          Below is an interactive converter that demonstrates how decimal values are represented in balanced ternary:

          <BalancedTernaryConverter />
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mt-10">Network Protocol</h2>
        <p>
          The TritCoin network protocol is designed to be lightweight and resilient. Nodes communicate using a custom
          protocol built on top of WebSockets, enabling real-time propagation of transactions and blocks across the
          network.
        </p>

        <p>The protocol includes mechanisms for:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Peer discovery and network topology management</li>
          <li>Transaction and block propagation</li>
          <li>Consensus participation</li>
          <li>Chain synchronization for new or reconnecting nodes</li>
          <li>Network health monitoring and attack resistance</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          All network messages are encoded in balanced ternary for maximum efficiency, reducing bandwidth requirements
          by approximately 37% compared to binary encoding.
