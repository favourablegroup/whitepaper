        <p>
          One of TritCoin's primary advantages is its inherent resistance to quantum computing attacks. Traditional
          binary-based cryptocurrencies rely on the computational difficulty of certain mathematical problems that
          quantum computers could potentially solve efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>TritCoin's balanced ternary architecture provides natural resistance to quantum attacks through:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Post-Quantum Cryptography:</strong> TritCoin implements cryptographic primitives specifically
            designed to resist quantum attacks, including hash-based signatures and lattice-based encryption.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ternary Logic Gates:</strong> The fundamental mathematical operations in balanced ternary create
            computational challenges that are not easily parallelized by quantum algorithms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Increased State Space:</strong> The three-state nature of balanced ternary increases the complexity
            of brute-force attacks exponentially compared to binary systems.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mt-10">Attack Vectors and Mitigations</h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">51% Attacks</h3>
        <p>
          The Proof-of-Balance consensus mechanism requires attackers to control a significantly larger portion of the
          network's computational resources compared to traditional PoW systems. The balanced distribution requirement
          in the consensus algorithm makes it mathematically more difficult to sustain an attack.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Sybil Attacks</h3>
        <p>
          TritCoin implements a reputation system based on node history and behavior, making it costly for attackers to
          create and maintain multiple identities. The system assigns trust scores to nodes based on their participation
          in the network and penalizes suspicious behavior.
        </p>

        <CodeBlock
          language="typescript"
          code={`
function calculateNodeTrustScore(node) {
  const uptime = node.getUptimePercentage();
  const consensusParticipation = node.getConsensusParticipationRate();
  const validTransactions = node.getValidTransactionRate();
  const networkContribution = node.getNetworkContribution();
  
  // Weighted scoring algorithm
  return (uptime * 0.2) + 
         (consensusParticipation * 0.3) + 
         (validTransactions * 0.3) + 
         (networkContribution * 0.2);
}`}
        />

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Double-Spending</h3>
        <p>
          TritCoin's transaction validation includes temporal checks that prevent double-spending attempts. The network
          requires multiple confirmations before considering a transaction final, with the number of required
          confirmations scaling with the transaction value.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mt-10">Formal Security Proofs</h2>
        <p>
          The TritCoin protocol has undergone rigorous formal verification using mathematical proofs to demonstrate its
          security properties. These proofs establish:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Safety: The protocol never confirms conflicting transactions</li>
          <li>Liveness: Valid transactions are eventually confirmed</li>
          <li>Fault tolerance: The system continues to operate correctly even if a fraction of nodes are malicious</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The formal security analysis uses techniques from distributed systems theory, game theory, and cryptography to
          provide mathematical guarantees about the protocol's behavior under various attack scenarios.
